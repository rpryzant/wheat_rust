compute_deltas.py         -  looks at the MODIS pixel data, joins the timeseries for each location with
		             that location's disease label, and then computes and saves the following:
	                               (max green pixel)  -   (one month later pixel)

classify_deltas[.py | .R] -  python and R script that do the same thing: run a linear classifier (svm) 
		             over all 7 bands of the delta pixels (each band is a feature)

tsne.R                    -  map delta pixels down to two dimensions with t-sne, then plot

results/                  -  experiment results and figures

data/                     -  raw pixel delta examples fed into the svm for varying disease thresholds
			     (higher threshold means that it's harder to get a "1" for disease)
